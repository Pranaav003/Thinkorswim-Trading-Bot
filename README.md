# Thinkorswim-Trading-Bot
A versatile trading bot harnessing AI, chart signals, and diverse indicators, enriched by a trader's market expertise.

Created in Thinkscript, the bot uses several tried and true strategies to get an edge on the market and other traders. The program strategy is easy to pick up, but difficult to master, as the skill ceiling only goes up as the trader gets better. The program works by proving recommendations on where to enter/exit, but the final decision is up to the trader, who makes decisions based on the various strategies visualised by the trading bot.
